The Waterfox source code is made to be able to be compiled by Intel's C++ compiler for Windows. You should be able to
install it and compile Waterfox without any issues. Other modifications and patches that are more
upstream have been implemented as well to fix any compatibility/security issues that Mozilla may 
lag behind in implementing (usually due to not being high priority).

Waterfox is released under the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0:

To have your bug fix / feature added to Mozilla, you should create a patch and
submit it to Bugzilla (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org). Instructions are at:

    http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Creating_a_patch
    http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Getting_your_patch_in_the_tree

If you have a question about developing Mozilla, and can't find the solution
on http://developer.mozilla.org, you can try asking your question in a
mozilla.* Usenet group, or on IRC at irc.mozilla.org. [The Mozilla news groups
are accessible on Google Groups, or news.mozilla.org with a NNTP reader.]

You can download nightly development builds from the Mozilla FTP server.
Keep in mind that nightly builds, which are used by Mozilla developers for
testing, may be buggy. Firefox nightlies, for example, can be found at:

    ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/
            - or -
    http://nightly.mozilla.org/
